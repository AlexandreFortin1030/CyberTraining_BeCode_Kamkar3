##### Structure of the presentation #####



### I/ Creating a .jpg file ###

# 1/ Create an inode.
The inode is a data structure that contains metadata about another file such as size, time stamp, memory block address etc.

# 2/ Create a register entry (waldo.jpg).
A register entry is an entry located in a specific register thta keeps track of all the files on the computer by name and is linked to their respective inode.

# 3/ Memory block allocation (reserve space).
A memory block or sector is found and allocated to the file that is being created.

# 4/ Writes the memory blocks starting with file's jpg signature (FF D8 FF) and finishing with (FF D9).
In between is the data defining the actual content of the file.




### II/ Erase file ###

# 1/ Remove the directory entry

# 2/ The inode is deallocated 

# 3/ The memory blocks are also deallocated
Which means the data and signature around it remain until covered by something else.




### III/ Photorec ###

# 1/ Scans the disk for unallocated or free sectors (memory blocks) for letfover data.
(Photorec looks for orphaned blocks, and do not work with inode or register entry.)

# 2/ It scans the memory blocks for signatures in this example: (FF D8 FF --- FF D9).

# 3/ It reconstructs the .jpg file with the data in between the start and end signature.

# 4/ Saves the file to a new location.




### IV/ shredScript

# 1/ Overwrite file's data blocks multiple times with random data.

# 2/ Overwrite file's data blocks with zeroes (default value).

# 3/ Removes the inode and it's metadata as well as the directory entry.
